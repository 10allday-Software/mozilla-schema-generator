# The incompatibility-allowlist is meant to circumvent schema validation when
# removing schemas from the schema repository. To use this, add a line that
# matches the convention `{namespace}.{doctype}.{docversion}`. Globs may be used.
# This is is only required for commits that introduce a schema deletion or allow
# for incompatible changes in columns.

# Example:
# telemetry.untrustedModules.*

# Bug 1689513
glean-js-tmp.*

# Bug 1697602
telemetry.account-ecosystem.*
firefox-accounts.account-ecosystem.*

# Bug 1703615, commit 26d53ee
# This commit needs to be reverted due to the schema being incorrect.
