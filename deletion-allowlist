# The deletion-allowlist is meant to circumvent schema validation when removing
# schemas from the schema repository. To use this, add a line that matches the
# convention `{namespace}.{doctype}.{docversion}`. Globs may be used. This is
# is only required for commits that introduce a schema deletion.

# Example:
# telemetry.untrustedModules.*
